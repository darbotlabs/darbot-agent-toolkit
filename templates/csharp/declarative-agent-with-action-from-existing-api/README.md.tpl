```yaml
  - uses: oauth/register
    with:
      name: {{ApiSpecAuthName}}
      flow: authorizationCode
      # app ID
      appId: ${{TEAMS_APP_ID}}
      # Path to OpenAPI description document
      apiSpecPath: {{{ApiSpecPath}}}
      # Uncomment below property to use proof key for code exchange (PKCE)
      isPKCEEnabled: true
    writeToEnvironmentFile:
